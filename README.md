### Initialize the project :

3. run the script and enjoy

### Change form the original game :

- From an intense adventuring game to a relaxing fishing  game
- Use of the random module for fishing
- add of a sleep function to avoid overwork

### How to Play and win condition ? :

- You need to run your script with your IDE or with the command ```python gamedev.py```

In my game the goal (Win condition) is to get the treaasure but unlike most of the games the goal is also to take your time to finish the game and gather a lot of items.

### ***When you start a party you have a choice of 7 commands :***

````go (south,north,west,east)```: Change your zone to catch new fish species !

```fishing``` : catch a random fish between all the species in your zone, BE CAREFULL YOUR ENERGY DICREASE RANDOMLY AFTER EACH CAPTURE BE CAREFULL TO NOT OVERWORK YOURSELF

```sleep``` : important to recover your energy ! In this game you can't loose but its important to be carefull of your health !

```look``` : show my current location informations.

```stats``` : Usefull to know if you're tired or not but when you use this command your energy isn't shown with statistics but only with a sentence so be carefull to listen yourself.
